Code review: I ran into multiple bugs on this assignment and I just took out the parts I could not fix and changed the parts I could fix. One big bug is the gallery Icons on the last two
gallery photos and one would not have the <figcaption> go below the photo and the other one has issues with the :hover function.
The benefit from this is I learned to be more patient with myself and my coding and just practiced problem solving.
Attributes: Mozilla helped me with flexbox learning to make the columns and rows change and I got the social media icon from SVG icons.
